# FIXED ISSUES SUMMARY

## Issues Fixed:

1. **CORS Configuration Error**
   - Problem: Frontend on port 3000 couldn't communicate with backend API due to CORS policy restrictions
   - Root cause: 
     - Frontend tried to connect to port 5000 instead of 5001
     - CORS headers were being blocked by Helmet middleware
   - Solution:
     - Updated API URL in frontend to point to port 5001
     - Moved CORS middleware before Helmet middleware
     - Added explicit CORS headers and methods permissions
     - Configured Helmet to allow cross-origin resource sharing

2. **Missing/Invalid Icon Files**
   - Problem: Console errors about missing logo files in manifest
   - Root cause:
     - Placeholder icon files were created but empty/invalid
   - Solution:
     - Created SVG-based icons for all required sizes
     - Updated manifest.json and index.html to reference SVG files
     - Changed MIME types to match SVG format

## Testing the Application:

1. Backend server is running on port 5001
2. Frontend client is running on port 3000
3. Login should now work correctly using these credentials:

   - **Project Team**
     - Username: project
     - Password: project@123
     - Permission: Can edit Project Team sections only, but can view all parts

   - **Finance Team**
     - Username: finance
     - Password: finance@321
     - Permission: Can edit Finance Team sections only, but can view all parts

   - **View Only (All Users)**
     - Username: deeptec
     - Password: deeptec
     - Permission: Can view all parts, but cannot edit anything

## Verification:

Open the browser console (F12) while using the application. There should be no CORS errors or icon-related warnings.

See [CORS_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md](./CORS_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md) and [ICON_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md](./ICON_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md) for detailed documentation of the fixes.
