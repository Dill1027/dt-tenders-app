# Image Split Instructions for IMG_0197.JPG

## Problem
The `IMG_0197.JPG` mobile screenshot is very tall and takes up too much vertical space in the README.

## Solution
Split the tall image into two separate images to display side by side.

## Steps to Split the Image:

### Option 1: Using Preview (Mac)
1. Open `IMG_0197.JPG` in Preview
2. Select the **Rectangular Selection Tool**
3. Select the **top half** of the image
4. Copy (Cmd+C) and paste into a new document (Cmd+N, then Cmd+V)
5. Save as `IMG_0197_top.JPG`
6. Repeat for the **bottom half** and save as `IMG_0197_bottom.JPG`

### Option 2: Using Any Image Editor
1. Open `IMG_0197.JPG` in your preferred image editor
2. Crop the top 50% of the image
3. Save as `IMG_0197_top.JPG`
4. Open the original again and crop the bottom 50%
5. Save as `IMG_0197_bottom.JPG`

### Option 3: Online Tool
Use an online image splitter like:
- Canva
- Photopea (free Photoshop alternative)
- Any online image cropping tool

## After Splitting
Once you have both images, the README will display them side by side in a table format, which will:
- Reduce the overall height
- Make better use of horizontal space
- Improve the visual layout
- Make the documentation more compact and easier to read

## Current Table Layout
The README now uses a table format that will display:
| Mobile Dashboard | Mobile Project Management |
|:----------------:|:-------------------------:|

This approach keeps images properly sized and organized.
