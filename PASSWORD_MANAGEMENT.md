# Password Management Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the password management features implemented in the DT Tenders application, including password change and password reset functionality.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Password Change

- **Backend**: Implemented `/auth/change-password` endpoint that requires authentication
- **Frontend**: Created a Profile page with a password change form
- **Security**: Requires current password verification before allowing changes

### 2. Password Reset (Forgot Password)

- **Backend**:  
  - Implemented `/auth/forgot-password` endpoint to request a reset code
  - Implemented `/auth/reset-password` endpoint to verify code and set new password
- **Frontend**:
  - Created a ForgotPassword component with request form
  - Created a ResetPassword component with verification and new password form
  - Added "Forgot Password" link on the Login page
- **Security**:
  - Password reset codes expire after 1 hour
  - Codes are hashed in the database
  - Generic responses to prevent username enumeration

## Technical Implementation

### User Model Additions

- Added `passwordResetCode` field to store hashed reset codes
- Added `passwordResetExpires` field to enforce time limits on reset codes

### Routes Added

- Frontend routes:
  - `/profile` - Password change form (protected)
  - `/forgot-password` - Request password reset
  - `/reset-password` - Complete password reset with code

### Security Considerations

- All password fields are properly validated with length requirements
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Password change requires current password verification
- Password reset uses time-limited codes
- Development mode shows reset codes directly (would be sent via email in production)

## Testing

To test the password management features:

1. **Password Change**:
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Navigate to Profile page
   - Enter current password and new password

2. **Password Reset**:
   - On Login page, click "Forgot Password"
   - Enter username
   - Note the reset code (visible in development mode)
   - Enter the code, username, and new password on the reset page

## Future Enhancements

- Add email integration for password reset codes
- Implement rate limiting for reset attempts
- Add notification when password is changed
- Add two-factor authentication option
