# ICON ISSUE RESOLUTION

This document describes how the icon display issues were resolved in the DT Tenders application.

## The Issue

The application was displaying warnings about missing or invalid icons:

```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: http://localhost:3000/logo192.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
```

## The Solution

The issue was fixed by:

1. Creating SVG-based icons instead of PNG files
   - SVG icons scale well and can be created programmatically
   - Created favicon.svg, logo192.svg, and logo512.svg

2. Updating the manifest.json and index.html files to reference the SVG files
   - Changed file references from .png to .svg
   - Updated MIME types to image/svg+xml

## The Fixed Code

### Updated index.html

```html
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.svg" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.svg" />
```

### Updated manifest.json

```json
"icons": [
  {
    "src": "favicon.svg",
    "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
    "type": "image/svg+xml"
  },
  {
    "src": "logo192.svg",
    "type": "image/svg+xml",
    "sizes": "192x192"
  },
  {
    "src": "logo512.svg", 
    "type": "image/svg+xml",
    "sizes": "512x512"
  }
]
```

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the application should display the correct icons without warnings in the browser console.
