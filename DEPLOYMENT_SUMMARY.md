# DT TENDERS Deployment Summary

## Deployment Information

The DT TENDERS application has been successfully deployed to Vercel on September 9, 2025.

### Application URLs

- **Frontend Application:** [https://frontend-pi-wine-91.vercel.app](https://frontend-pi-wine-91.vercel.app)
- **Backend API:** [https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app](https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app)
- **API Root Endpoint:** [https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app/](https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app/) (Returns available endpoints)
- **API Health Check:** [https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app/api/health](https://backend-rho-ten-64.vercel.app/api/health)

### Important Note

To use the application successfully, you need to disable Protection in Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your backend project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Security
4. In the 'Authentication' section, toggle off 'Protection'
5. Save the changes

## Post-Deployment Verification

Please perform the following checks to ensure the application is working correctly:

1. Visit the frontend URL and verify you can access the login page
2. Log in with valid credentials and verify you can access the dashboard
3. Test the following features:
   - Creating a new project
   - Viewing project details
   - Updating project information
   - Testing role-based permissions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployed application:

1. **CORS Issues:** Verify that the CORS configuration in the server is correctly set up to allow requests from the frontend URL
2. **Authentication Issues:** Ensure that the frontend is correctly sending API requests to the backend URL
3. **404 Errors on Page Refresh:** This is expected behavior for SPAs. The Vercel configuration should redirect all requests to index.html, but if you encounter issues, verify the vercel.json file in the client directory

## Next Steps

1. Consider setting up a custom domain for the application
2. Configure automated deployments using GitHub integration with Vercel
3. Set up monitoring and logging for the application
